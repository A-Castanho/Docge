An app to manage documents. Eveloped during my time as an intern at Orange Digital Agency.
The objective is to connect entrepreneurs and their employees in a drive system.
Developed with Firebase Services, every employee registered here has their own storage area where they can upload and download files for and from their superiors. The superiors have access to everyone's storage areas and can do just the same in each one of them, as well as register new employees.
